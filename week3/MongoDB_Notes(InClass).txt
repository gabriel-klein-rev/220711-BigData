MongoDB

- MongoDB is a NoSQL language
    - "Not Only" SQL
    - MongoDB is a document based NoSQL DBMS
    - NoSQL db features include (lack of a db schema), data clustering, replication support, eventual consistency
    - MongoDB provides high performance, high availability, easy scalability (good for big data)

RDBMS               MongoDB
Database            Database
Table               Collection
Row                 Documents
Columns             Field
JOIN                Embedded documents

- In RDMBS, we can design our db using normalization (create relations with fk, etc)

- In MongoDB, no rules for db design

    - Only thing that matters when we design a db is making something that works for OUR application

    - Things to take into account:
        - How to store the data
        - Provide good query performance
        - Keep in mind hardware limitations
    
    - In SQL languages, we have the ACID properties of a transaction
    - In NoSQL languages, we have the BASE properties of transactions
	- Basically Available
		- Ensuring availability of data through data replication
	- Soft State
		- Delegating the responsibility of enforcing consistency to the developer
	- Eventual Consistency
		- Eventually, the db across all nodes throughout the cluster will be consistent

- Sharding
	- Utilizing multiple systems to increase the resources in a server/cluster
	- Example of "horizontal scaling"
