- Node Manager
  - Responsible for the execution of the task in each

  - Manages workflow and user jobs on a specific node
  - Send a heartbeat to the Resource Manager with
    information of the resources in each container.
  - Container
	- Set of resources (RAM, CPU, Storage) on a single

	- Resources are allocated by the Resource Manager
