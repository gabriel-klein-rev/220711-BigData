SQL PRIMARY KEY Constraint
The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.
Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.
A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

INSERT INTO Persons (ID,LastName,FirstName,Age)
VALUES (010,'West','George',31);
-------------------------------------------------------------------
4) 
SQL FOREIGN KEY Constraint
The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.
A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Persons Table
PersonID	LastName	FirstName	Age
1	        Hansen	         Ola	        30
2	        Svendson	Tove	        23
3	        Pettersen	Kari	        20
----------------------------------------------------------
Orders Table
OrderID	OrderNumber	PersonID
1	77895	         3
2	44678	         3
3	22456	         2
4	24562	         1
-------------------------------------------------------
Notice that the "PersonID" column in the "Orders" table points to the "PersonID" column in the "Persons" table.
The "PersonID" column in the "Persons" table is the PRIMARY KEY in the "Persons" table.
The "PersonID" column in the "Orders" table is a FOREIGN KEY in the "Orders" table.
The FOREIGN KEY constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, because it has to be one of the values contained in the parent table.

-----------------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);

Joins/Injections-->Assignment
----------Returns the cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
SELECT City FROM Customers UNION SELECT City FROM Suppliers ORDER BY City;
---------returns the cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
SELECT City FROM Customers UNION ALL SELECT City FROM Suppliers ORDER BY City;
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), CountryFROM Customers GROUP BY Country;
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;
-------- SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, sorted high to low (Only include countries with more than 5 customers):
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5 ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
------SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the suppliers with a product price less than 20:
SELECT SupplierName FROM Suppliers WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price < 20);
--------SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity larger than 1000 (this will return FALSE because the Quantity column has no values larger than 1000):
SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE ProductID = ANY (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity > 1000);

--------SQL statement lists the ProductName if ALL the records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity equal to 10. This will of course return FALSE because the Quantity column has many different values (not only the value of 10):
SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE ProductID = ALL (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10);

---------SQL goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met:
SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE
    WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN 'The quantity is greater than 30'
    WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN 'The quantity is 30'
    ELSE 'The quantity is under 30'
END AS QuantityText
FROM OrderDetails;

------SQL statement creates a stored procedure named "SelectAllCustomers" that selects all records from the "Customers" table:
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers AS SELECT * FROM Customers GO;
EXEC SelectAllCustomers;

-----single-line comment to ignore a statement:
--SELECT * FROM Customers;

multi-line comment as an explanation:
/*Select all the columns
of all the records
in the Customers table:*/
SELECT * FROM Customers;

The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:

NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updating a table with indexes takes more time than updating a table without (because the indexes also need an update). So, only create indexes on columns that will be frequently searched against.
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON Persons (LastName);
---------------------------------------------------------
---------"Personid" column to be an auto-increment primary key field in the "Persons" table:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    Personid int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    PRIMARY KEY (Personid)
);
-------------------------------------------------------------
SQL Date Data Types
MySQL comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database:

DATE - format YYYY-MM-DD
DATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
TIMESTAMP - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
YEAR - format YYYY or YY

SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate='2008-11-11'
-----------------------------------------------------
CREATE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
------------------------------------------------
The most common SQL hosting databases are MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and MS Access.

DROP DATABASE testDB;
DROP TABLE Shippers;
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

Window functions operate on a set of rows and return a single aggregated value for each row. The term Window describes the set of rows in the database on which the function will operate.

We define the Window (set of rows on which functions operates) using an OVER() clause. We will discuss more about the OVER() clause in the article below.

Types of Window functions
Aggregate Window Functions
SUM(), MAX(), MIN(), AVG(). COUNT()
---------------------------------------------
Ranking Window Functions
RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()
There are 3 types of ranking functions supported in MySQL-
dense_rank()
This function will assign rank to each row within a partition without gaps. Basically, the ranks are assigned in a consecutive manner i.e if there is a tie between values then they will be assigned the same rank, and next rank value will be one greater then the previous rank assigned.
rank():
This function will assign rank to each row within a partition with gaps. Here, ranks are assigned in a non-consecutive manner i.e if there is a tie between values then they will be assigned same rank, and next rank value will be previous rank + no of peers(duplicates).
percent_rank():
It returns the percentile rank of a row within a partition that ranges from 0 to 1. It tells the percentage of partition values less than the value in the current row, excluding the highest value.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Value Window Functions
LAG(), LEAD(), FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE()
The LAG() function is used to get value from row that precedes the current row.

The LEAD() function is used to get value from row that succedes the current row.
