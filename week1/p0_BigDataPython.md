## Git Help

For this project, we only need basic Git and GitHub usage.  You should do these steps once, to set up:
- Make a Github Account
- Create a repository
- Use the git clone command on your local machine to clone the repository to your local machine

You should run the following commands frequently, while working on your project, in your git repo:
- git status (just to see what has changed)
- git add .
- git commit -m "a message describing the work you've done goes here"
- git push

If you receive an error message that you aren't in a git repo, cd to your cloned git repository on your local machine.
