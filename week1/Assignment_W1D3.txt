PYTHON ASSIGNMENT W1D3


def filter_list(lst) -> list:
1) Write a Python function that will take in a list of numbers and return a new list of numbers that include only the elements of the first that are between 10 and 19 (inclusive)
	
	ex) filter_list([1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 45, 26, 19, 15, 3]) ------> [10, 19, 15]


def intersect_sets(set1, set2) -> set:
2) Write a Python function that will take in two sets and return the intersection of both. If there are no common values, print to the console that there are no common values.
	
	ex) intersect_sets({1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4, 5}) ------> {2, 3}


def create_dict(lst_keys, lst_values) -> dict:
3) Write a Python function that will take in a list of unique keys and a list of tuples that will represent values, and return a dictionary with each element in the lst_values mapped to a key in lst_keys. lst_values will be a list of tuples, lst_keys will be a list of strings. length of each list will be the same.

	ex) create_dict(["fred", "stacy", "bob"], [(1, 5), (4, 7), (9, 2)]) ------> {"fred":(1, 5), "stacy":(4, 7), "bob":(9, 2)}
